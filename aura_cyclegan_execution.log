::group::Healing 'numpy': Filter-Then-Scan Strategy

--- Phase 1: Filtering for compatible versions ---
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.4.2...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict is caused by the current Python environment being too old to satisfy the `Requires-Python` constraints for the requested `numpy==2.4.2` (which needs Python >=3.11), and similarly for other ignored versions like `numpy 2.3.0`, `1.16.0`, `1.17.0`, `1.14.0`, `1.15.0`, `12.0.0`, and `2.1.0` (which require Python >=3.10 or >=3.11).
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.4.1...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict is caused by the requested `numpy==2.4.1` requiring Python >=3.11, while the current environment is running an older, incompatible Python version.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.4.0...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is that the requested `numpy==2.4.0` cannot be satisfied because it and numerous other versions including `1.14.0`, `1.14.0rc1`, `1.14.0rc2`, `1.14.1`, `1.15.0`, `1.15.0rc1`, `1.15.0rc2`, `1.15.1`, `1.15.2`, `1.15.3` (all requiring `Python >=3.10`); `1.16.0`, `1.16.0rc1`, `1.16.0rc2`, `1.16.1`, `1.16.2`, `1.16.3`, `1.17.0`, `1.17.0rc1`, `1.17.0rc2` (all requiring `Python >=3.11`); `12.0.0`, `12.1.0` (all requiring `Python >=3.10`); `2.1.0`, `2.1.1`, `2.1.2`, `2.1.3`, `2.2.0`, `2.2.1`, `2.2.2`, `2.2.3`, `2.2.4`, `2.2.5`, `2.2.6` (all requiring `Python >=3.10`); `2.3.0`, `2.3.1`, `2.3.2`, `2.3.3`, `2.3.4`, `2.3.5` (all requiring `Python >=3.11`); and `2.4.0rc1`, `2.4.1`, `2.4.2` (all requiring `Python >=3.11`) are being ignored because the current Python environment is older than their respective minimum `Python` version requirements.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.3.5...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is that the system requires `numpy==2.3.5`, but this specific version explicitly `Requires-Python >=3.11`, while the current Python environment is an older version, causing `numpy==2.3.5` to be ignored and unavailable.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.3.4...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict is caused by the requested `numpy==2.3.4` requiring Python version `>=3.11`, which also leads to other `numpy` versions like `1.14.0` (requiring `>=3.10`) and `2.1.0` (requiring `>=3.10`) being ignored due to an incompatible current Python environment.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.3.3...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is that the requested `numpy==2.3.3`, along with other `numpy` versions like `2.3.0` through `2.3.5` and many others listed, requires Python >=3.11 and was therefore ignored, leaving no compatible distribution for the current Python environment.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.3.2...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is that the current Python environment does not meet the `Python >=3.10` or `Python >=3.11` version requirements for the desired `numpy==2.3.2` and other specific `numpy` versions, including `1.14.0`, `1.14.0rc1`, `1.14.0rc2`, `1.14.1`, `1.15.0`, `1.15.0rc1`, `1.15.0rc2`, `1.15.1`, `1.15.2`, `1.15.3`, `1.16.0`, `1.16.0rc1`, `1.16.0rc2`, `1.16.1`, `1.16.2`, `1.16.3`, `1.17.0`, `1.17.0rc1`, `1.17.0rc2`, `12.0.0`, `12.1.0`, `2.1.0`, `2.1.1`, `2.1.2`, `2.1.3`, `2.2.0`, `2.2.1`, `2.2.2`, `2.2.3`, `2.2.4`, `2.2.5`, `2.2.6`, `2.3.0`, `2.3.1`, `2.3.2`, `2.3.3`, `2.3.4`, `2.3.5`, `2.4.0`, `2.4.0rc1`, `2.4.1`, and `2.4.2`.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.3.1...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict occurs because the requested `numpy==2.3.1` requires Python 3.11 or newer, but the current Python environment does not satisfy this requirement, causing `numpy==2.3.1` to be ignored and therefore unavailable.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.3.0...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict is caused by the inability to find `numpy==2.3.0` because it, along with other `numpy` versions from `1.14.0` up to `2.4.2`, requires Python 3.10 or newer (or 3.11 for many of the newer versions), which is incompatible with the current Python environment.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.2.6...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict occurs because the requested `numpy==2.2.6` (along with versions `2.1.0` through `2.2.6` and others) requires Python version >=3.10, but the current Python environment is older, causing these specific versions to be ignored and unavailable.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.2.5...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict's root cause is that the requested `numpy==2.2.5` (which requires Python >=3.10) and many other available versions, such as `1.14.0` (Python >=3.10) and `1.16.0` (Python >=3.11), are incompatible with the current Python environment.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.2.4...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict is caused by the desired `numpy==2.2.4` requiring Python >=3.10, while the current Python environment is an older, incompatible version, making `numpy==2.2.4` unavailable.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.2.3...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict is caused by the requested `numpy==2.2.3` (along with other versions ranging from `2.1.0` to `2.4.2`) being ignored because they require a higher Python version (e.g., >=3.10 or >=3.11) than is currently available.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.2.2...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is that the requested `numpy==2.2.2` requires Python version 3.10 or higher, but the current Python environment does not meet this requirement, leading `pip` to ignore this specific version along with other versions like `1.14.0`, `1.16.0`, and `2.3.0` that also have higher Python version requirements.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.2.1...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict is caused by the requested `numpy==2.2.1` requiring Python >=3.10, while the current environment uses an incompatible Python version, leading to `numpy==2.2.1` being ignored and not found.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.2.0...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is that the requested `numpy==2.2.0` and many other modern versions (e.g., `1.14.0`, `2.1.0`, `2.3.0`) require Python 3.10 or 3.11, which is not met by the current Python environment.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.1.3...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict is caused by the desired `numpy==2.1.3` and many other `numpy` versions (e.g., `1.14.0`, `2.1.0`, `2.2.0`, `2.3.0`, `2.4.0`) requiring Python 3.10 or higher, which is incompatible with the current Python environment.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.1.2...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict stems from the requested `numpy==2.1.2` requiring `Python >=3.10`, which is incompatible with the current Python environment, causing `pip` to ignore it along with other `numpy` versions like `1.14.0`, `2.1.0`, `2.1.1`, `2.1.3`, and `2.4.2` that also have Python version constraints.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.1.1...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict is caused because the requested `numpy==2.1.1` requires Python >= 3.10, but the current Python environment does not satisfy this version requirement, leading to `numpy==2.1.1` and other `numpy` versions like `1.14.0`, `1.15.0`, `1.16.0`, `1.17.0`, `12.0.0`, `2.1.0`, `2.2.0`, `2.3.0`, and `2.4.0` being ignored.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.1.0...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict is caused by the system requiring `numpy==2.1.0`, but this version (along with others like `numpy==1.14.0` and `numpy==1.16.0`) requires Python >=3.10 or >=3.11, which is newer than the currently used Python environment.

::group::Healing 'torch': Filter-Then-Scan Strategy

--- Phase 1: Filtering for compatible versions ---
  -> Checking compatibility of torch==2.10.0...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict arises because the required `torch==2.10.0` is not found among the available distributions, with the highest compatible version listed being `torch==2.8.0`, and many newer versions, specifically `torch==1.14.0` through `torch==2.4.2` (and `12.0.0`, `12.1.0`), are explicitly ignored due to requiring a different Python version (>=3.10 or >=3.11).
  -> Checking compatibility of torch==2.9.1...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict is caused by the current Python environment being too old to satisfy the `torch==2.9.1` requirement, as only `torch` versions up to `2.8.0` are compatible, while other newer package versions, such as `1.14.0`, `2.1.0`, `2.3.0`, and `12.0.0`, were ignored due to requiring Python >=3.10 or >=3.11.
  -> Checking compatibility of torch==2.9.0...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is that the requested `torch==2.9.0` is not found among the available versions (which range from `1.7.1` up to `2.8.0`), and many other `torch` versions like `2.1.0` through `2.4.2` are explicitly ignored because they require a higher Python version of `3.10` or `3.11`.
  -> Checking compatibility of torch==2.8.0...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict arises because `torch==2.8.0` and `torchvision==0.8.2` have incompatible underlying dependencies.
  -> Checking compatibility of torch==2.7.1...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict arises because `torch==2.7.1` and `torchvision==0.8.2` have incompatible internal dependencies.
  -> Checking compatibility of torch==2.7.0...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict arises because installing `torch==2.7.0` and `torchvision==0.8.2` simultaneously results in incompatible requirements for their respective dependencies.
  -> Checking compatibility of torch==2.6.0...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict arises because `torch==2.6.0` and `torchvision==0.8.2` have incompatible requirements for their respective internal dependencies when installed together.
  -> Checking compatibility of torch==2.5.1...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: Torch==2.5.1 and torchvision==0.8.2 cannot be installed together because their specific versions have conflicting dependencies.
  -> Checking compatibility of torch==2.5.0...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is that `torch==2.5.0` and `torchvision==0.8.2` have conflicting internal dependencies, preventing their simultaneous installation.
  -> Checking compatibility of torch==2.4.1...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict is caused by `torch==2.4.1` and `torchvision==0.8.2` having conflicting dependencies that prevent their simultaneous installation.
  -> Checking compatibility of torch==2.4.0...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The conflict arises because `torch==2.4.0` and `torchvision==0.8.2` have conflicting underlying dependencies that cannot be simultaneously satisfied.
  -> Checking compatibility of torch==2.3.1...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict arises because `torch==2.3.1` and `torchvision==0.8.2` have incompatible internal dependency requirements, preventing their simultaneous installation.
  -> Checking compatibility of torch==2.3.0...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict is caused by the specific versions `torch==2.3.0` and `torchvision==0.8.2` having incompatible dependencies with each other.
  -> Checking compatibility of torch==2.2.2...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is that `torch==2.2.2` and `torchvision==0.8.2` cannot be installed together because they have conflicting dependencies.
  -> Checking compatibility of torch==2.2.1...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is that `torch==2.2.1` and `torchvision==0.8.2` have incompatible internal dependency requirements with each other.
  -> Checking compatibility of torch==2.2.0...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is that `torch==2.2.0` and `torchvision==0.8.2` have incompatible underlying dependencies, preventing them from being installed simultaneously.
  -> Checking compatibility of torch==2.1.2...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict arises because `torch==2.1.2` and `torchvision==0.8.2` have incompatible requirements for one or more of their underlying dependencies.
  -> Checking compatibility of torch==2.1.1...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is that `torch==2.1.1` and `torchvision==0.8.2` have incompatible requirements for their underlying dependencies.

     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is that `torch==2.0.0` and `torchvision==0.8.2` have conflicting dependencies, preventing their co-installation.
  -> Checking compatibility of torch==1.13.1...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict arises because `torch==1.13.1` and `torchvision==0.8.2` have incompatible sub-dependency requirements that prevent them from being installed together.
  -> Checking compatibility of torch==1.13.0...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict arises because `torch==1.13.0` and `torchvision==0.8.2` have incompatible internal dependency requirements.
  -> Checking compatibility of torch==1.12.1...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is that `torch==1.12.1` and `torchvision==0.8.2` have incompatible dependency requirements, preventing them from being installed together.
  -> Checking compatibility of torch==1.12.0...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is that `torch==1.12.0` and `torchvision==0.8.2` have incompatible dependency requirements, preventing their simultaneous installation.
  -> Checking compatibility of torch==1.11.0...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is that `torch==1.11.0` and `torchvision==0.8.2` have conflicting dependencies.

::group::Healing 'torchvision': Filter-Then-Scan Strategy

--- Phase 1: Filtering for compatible versions ---
  -> Checking compatibility of torchvision==0.25.0...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is that the requested `torchvision==0.25.0` is not an available package version (the highest listed is `0.23.0`), and simultaneously, many other dependency versions, such as `1.14.0`, `1.16.0`, `2.1.0`, `2.3.0`, and `12.0.0`, are ignored due to requiring Python 3.10 or higher, implying an incompatible older Python environment.
  -> Checking compatibility of torchvision==0.24.1...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is that the requested `torchvision` version `0.24.1` is not available in the package index, with the latest discoverable version being `0.23.0`.
  -> Checking compatibility of torchvision==0.24.0...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict stems from an outdated Python environment that is incompatible with required packages; specifically, `torchvision==0.24.0` is not found among available versions `0.1.6` through `0.23.0`, and other unspecified package versions including `1.14.0` through `1.17.2`, `12.0.0`, `12.1.0`, and `2.1.0` through `2.4.2` are ignored for requiring Python >=3.10 or >=3.11.
  -> Checking compatibility of torchvision==0.23.0...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict occurs because installing `torch==1.7.1` and `torchvision==0.23.0` simultaneously leads to incompatible requirements for their respective underlying dependencies.
  -> Checking compatibility of torchvision==0.22.1...

::group::Healing 'numpy': Filter-Then-Scan Strategy

--- Phase 1: Filtering for compatible versions ---
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.4.2...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is that the requested `numpy==2.4.2` (along with versions like `2.4.0` and `2.4.1`) requires Python version `>=3.11`, but the current Python environment is an older, incompatible version.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.4.1...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict is caused by the requested `numpy==2.4.1` requiring Python version `>=3.11`, which is incompatible with the current Python environment and thus causes `numpy==2.4.1` to be ignored and no matching distribution to be found.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.4.0...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict arises because the requested `numpy==2.4.0` cannot be installed as it, like other recent versions such as `numpy` `1.14.0` (requiring Python >=3.10) and `numpy` `2.3.0` (requiring Python >=3.11), is incompatible with the current Python environment.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.3.5...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict for `numpy==2.3.5` is caused by the current Python environment being incompatible with its `Requires-Python >=3.11` specification, which also applies to other `numpy` versions like `1.14.0` (Requires-Python >=3.10) and `2.3.0` (Requires-Python >=3.11), demanding a newer Python interpreter.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.3.4...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict for `numpy==2.3.4` is caused by this specific version requiring Python >=3.11, leading to it being ignored by the current Python environment.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.3.3...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict for `numpy==2.3.3` is caused by the current Python environment not meeting the package's requirement of Python >=3.11, leading to `numpy` versions `2.3.0` through `2.4.2` being ignored.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.3.2...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict is caused by the requested `numpy==2.3.2`, along with other `numpy` versions like `1.14.0`, `1.16.0`, `12.0.0`, `2.1.0`, and `2.3.0`, being ignored because they require a newer Python version (specifically Python >=3.11 for `numpy==2.3.2`) than the current environment provides.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.3.1...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict for `numpy==2.3.1` is caused by the current Python environment being too old, as this version, along with other `numpy` versions like `2.3.0` through `2.4.2` (requiring Python >=3.11) and `1.14.0` through `1.17.0`, `12.0.0`, `12.1.0`, and `2.1.0` through `2.2.6` (requiring Python >=3.10), were ignored due to incompatible Python version requirements.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.3.0...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is that the requested `numpy==2.3.0` cannot be found because it (along with `numpy` versions `2.3.1`, `2.3.2`, `2.3.3`, `2.3.4`, `2.3.5`, `2.4.0`, `2.4.0rc1`, `2.4.1`, and `2.4.2`) requires Python >=3.11, while the current Python environment is incompatible.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.2.6...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict is caused by the current Python environment being incompatible with the requested `numpy==2.2.6`, as many `numpy` versions, including `1.14.0`, `2.1.0`, `2.2.0` through `2.2.5`, `2.3.0`, and `12.0.0`, explicitly require Python 3.10 or newer.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.2.5...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict stems from the fact that the required `numpy==2.2.5` was explicitly ignored, along with other `numpy` versions from `2.1.0` to `2.2.6` and `2.3.0` to `2.4.2`, because they all require a Python version of 3.10 or newer, which the current environment does not provide.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.2.4...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict stems from the current Python environment being incompatible with the requested `numpy==2.2.4` (which requires Python >=3.10), causing it and other versions like `numpy` `1.14.0`, `1.16.0`, `2.3.0`, and `12.0.0` to be ignored due to their Python version requirements.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.2.3...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict's root cause is that the requested package `numpy==2.2.3`, along with other versions such as `2.1.0` through `2.2.6` and `2.3.0` through `2.4.2`, requires a Python version of `>=3.10` or `>=3.11` that is incompatible with the current Python environment.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.2.2...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict occurs because the required `numpy==2.2.2` was ignored as it explicitly requires Python version `>=3.10`, which is newer than the currently active Python environment.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.2.1...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is that the required `numpy==2.2.1` (along with versions from `2.2.0` to `2.2.6`) is ignored because it explicitly requires a Python version of `>=3.10`, which the current environment does not meet.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.2.0...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict is caused because the requested `numpy==2.2.0` requires `Python >=3.10`, which is incompatible with the current Python environment, resulting in `numpy==2.2.0` being ignored and unavailable.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.1.3...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is that the required `numpy==2.1.3` cannot be found because it (along with `numpy` versions `1.14.0` through `1.15.3`, `12.0.0` through `12.1.0`, and `2.1.0` through `2.2.6`) requires Python version `>=3.10`, while the current Python environment is incompatible, also causing `numpy` versions `1.16.0` through `1.17.0rc2` and `2.3.0` through `2.4.2` (which require Python `>=3.11`) to be ignored.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.1.2...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is that the required `numpy==2.1.2` (which needs Python >=3.10) and other `numpy` versions, specifically `1.14.0` to `1.17.0`, `2.1.0` to `2.4.2`, and `12.0.0` to `12.1.0`, were ignored because they require Python versions (>=3.10 or >=3.11) newer than the current environment.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.1.1...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict for `numpy==2.1.1` is caused by the current Python environment being older than 3.10, as `numpy` versions from `2.1.0` through `2.2.6` (among others) explicitly require `Python >=3.10`.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.1.0...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is that the required `numpy==2.1.0`, along with many other versions like `1.14.0`, `1.15.0`, `1.16.0`, `2.2.0`, `2.3.0`, `2.4.0`, and `12.0.0`, requires a newer Python version (specifically Python 3.10 or 3.11 and up) than the one currently installed, causing them to be ignored and `numpy==2.1.0` not to be found.

--- Phase 1: Filtering for compatible versions ---
  -> Checking compatibility of torchvision==0.25.0...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is that the requested `torchvision==0.25.0` could not be found as it is not listed among available versions (up to `0.23.0`), with the installation further hindered by an incompatible Python version which caused other package versions like `1.14.0` (requires Python >=3.10), `1.16.0` (requires Python >=3.11), and `2.3.0` (requires Python >=3.11) to be ignored.
  -> Checking compatibility of torchvision==0.24.1...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict stems from the current Python environment being too old to support `torchvision==0.24.1`, as `pip` ignored it and other newer package versions like `1.14.0` (requiring `Python >=3.10`) and `2.3.0` (requiring `Python >=3.11`) due to Python version incompatibility, making only `torchvision` versions up to `0.23.0` available.
  -> Checking compatibility of torchvision==0.24.0...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is that the requested `torchvision==0.24.0` is unavailable from the listed distributions, which only include versions from `0.1.6` through `0.23.0`, while numerous other package versions like `1.14.0`, `1.14.0rc1`, `1.14.0rc2`, `1.14.1`, `1.15.0`, `1.15.0rc1`, `1.15.0rc2`, `1.15.1`, `1.15.2`, `1.15.3`, `1.16.0`, `1.16.0rc1`, `1.16.0rc2`, `1.16.1`, `1.16.2`, `1.16.3`, `1.17.0`, `1.17.0rc1`, `1.17.0rc2`, `12.0.0`, `12.1.0`, `2.1.0`, `2.1.1`, `2.1.2`, `2.1.3`, `2.2.0`, `2.2.1`, `2.2.2`, `2.2.3`, `2.2.4`, `2.2.5`, `2.2.6`, `2.3.0`, `2.3.1`, `2.3.2`, `2.3.3`, `2.3.4`, `2.3.5`, `2.4.0`, `2.4.0rc1`, `2.4.1`, and `2.4.2` are concurrently ignored because they require a different Python version (>=3.10 or >=3.11).

    Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is the inability to find `torchvision==0.25.0` because this version does not exist among the available distributions (which range from `0.1.6` to `0.23.0`), compounded by numerous other dependency versions (e.g., `1.14.0` to `2.4.2`) being incompatible with the current Python version as they require Python >=3.10 or >=3.11.

--- Phase 1: Filtering for compatible versions ---
  -> Checking compatibility of Pillow==12.1.0...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict occurs because the requested `Pillow==12.1.0` requires Python version `>=3.10`, but the current Python environment does not meet this requirement, causing `12.1.0` (along with other versions like `1.14.0` through `1.17.0`, `12.0.0`, `2.1.0` through `2.4.2`) to be ignored and no matching distribution to be found.
  -> Checking compatibility of Pillow==12.0.0...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is that the current Python environment does not meet the `Requires-Python` specification of `Pillow==12.0.0` (which requires `>=3.10`) and several other available versions such as `1.14.0` (`Requires-Python >=3.10`), `1.16.0` (`Requires-Python >=3.11`), `2.1.0` (`Requires-Python >=3.10`), and `2.3.0` (`Requires-Python >=3.11`), causing them to be ignored.

::group::Healing 'numpy': Filter-Then-Scan Strategy

--- Phase 1: Filtering for compatible versions ---
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.4.2...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is that the current Python environment's version is too old for the requested `numpy==2.4.2`, which requires `Python >=3.11`, leading pip to ignore available `numpy` versions such as `1.14.0`, `1.15.0`, `1.16.0`, `1.17.0`, `12.0.0`, `12.1.0`, and `2.1.0` through `2.4.2` because they require `Python >=3.10` or `Python >=3.11`, consequently finding no matching distribution beyond `numpy==2.0.2`.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.4.1...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict's root cause is that the current Python environment does not meet the minimum requirement (>=3.10 or >=3.11) for the requested `numpy==2.4.1` and other `numpy` versions, including `1.14.0`, `1.14.0rc1`, `1.14.0rc2`, `1.14.1`, `1.15.0`, `1.15.0rc1`, `1.15.0rc2`, `1.15.1`, `1.15.2`, `1.15.3`, `1.16.0`, `1.16.0rc1`, `1.16.0rc2`, `1.16.1`, `1.16.2`, `1.16.3`, `1.17.0`, `1.17.0rc1`, `1.17.0rc2`, `12.0.0`, `12.1.0`, `2.1.0`, `2.1.1`, `2.1.2`, `2.1.3`, `2.2.0`, `2.2.1`, `2.2.2`, `2.2.3`, `2.2.4`, `2.2.5`, `2.2.6`, `2.3.0`, `2.3.1`, `2.3.2`, `2.3.3`, `2.3.4`, `2.3.5`, `2.4.0`, `2.4.0rc1`, and `2.4.2`, which leads to `pip` ignoring them and failing to find a matching distribution for `numpy==2.4.1`.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.4.0...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is that the requested `numpy==2.4.0` requires Python >=3.11, rendering it incompatible with the current Python environment and leading `pip` to ignore `numpy` versions `2.4.0`, `2.4.0rc1`, `2.4.1`, and `2.4.2`.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.3.5...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict is caused by the requested `numpy==2.3.5` (along with other versions such as `2.3.0` through `2.4.2`) requiring Python version `>=3.11`, which the current environment does not meet, leading `pip` to ignore these versions and fail to find a match.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.3.4...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is that the required `numpy==2.3.4` (along with other versions like `1.14.0` and `2.3.0`) was ignored because it explicitly requires a Python version `>=3.11` (or `>=3.10` for `1.14.0`), which is not met by the current Python environment, leaving no matching distribution among the compatible available versions (e.g., `1.3.0` through `2.0.2`).
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.3.3...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is that the current Python environment is too old, failing to meet the `Requires-Python` dependency of `numpy==2.3.3` (which specifically needs Python >= 3.11) and all other listed `numpy` versions, including `1.14.0`, `1.14.0rc1`, `1.14.0rc2`, `1.14.1`, `1.15.0`, `1.15.0rc1`, `1.15.0rc2`, `1.15.1`, `1.15.2`, `1.15.3`, `1.16.0`, `1.16.0rc1`, `1.16.0rc2`, `1.16.1`, `1.16.2`, `1.16.3`, `1.17.0`, `1.17.0rc1`, `1.17.0rc2`, `12.0.0`, `12.1.0`, `2.1.0`, `2.1.1`, `2.1.2`, `2.1.3`, `2.2.0`, `2.2.1`, `2.2.2`, `2.2.3`, `2.2.4`, `2.2.5`, `2.2.6`, `2.3.0`, `2.3.1`, `2.3.2`, `2.3.4`, `2.3.5`, `2.4.0`, `2.4.0rc1`, `2.4.1`, and `2.4.2`, which collectively require Python >= 3.10 or >= 3.11.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.3.2...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict for `numpy==2.3.2` arises because this specific version, along with others such as `2.3.0` through `2.4.2`, requires Python >=3.11, making it incompatible with the currently used Python environment.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.3.1...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict occurs because the requested `numpy==2.3.1` requires Python >=3.11, but the current Python environment is incompatible, causing `numpy==2.3.1` and other recent versions (e.g., 2.3.0 through 2.4.2) to be ignored.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.3.0...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict is caused by the requirement for `numpy==2.3.0`, which explicitly requires Python >=3.11 and is therefore incompatible with the current Python environment.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.2.6...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict is caused by the requested `numpy==2.2.6` requiring Python version >=3.10, which is not met by the current Python environment, leading to its unavailability for installation.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.2.5...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is that the requested `numpy==2.2.5` requires Python 3.10 or higher, which the current environment does not meet, resulting in this version, along with other Python-version-restricted distributions such as `1.14.0` and `2.1.0`, being ignored, and no matching `numpy` distribution found among available versions `1.3.0` through `2.0.2`.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.2.4...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict is caused by the requested `numpy==2.2.4` (and other versions like `1.14.0`, `2.1.0`, `2.2.5`) requiring Python >=3.10, which is incompatible with the current Python environment, leading to these versions being ignored.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.2.3...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict is caused by the requirement for `numpy==2.2.3`, which demands Python >=3.11, making it incompatible and unavailable in the current, older Python environment.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.2.2...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is that the required `numpy==2.2.2` cannot be installed because it, along with other versions such as `1.14.0`, `1.15.0`, `2.1.0`, `2.3.0`, and `2.4.0`, was ignored due to explicit `Requires-Python >=3.10` or `>=3.11` constraints that the current Python environment does not meet, leaving only `numpy` versions `1.3.0` through `2.0.2` as available options.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.2.1...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict stems from the current Python version being too old to install the requested `numpy==2.2.1`, as it and other versions like `numpy 2.2.0`, `2.1.0` (requiring Python >=3.10), and `2.3.0` (requiring Python >=3.11) are ignored due to Python version incompatibility.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.2.0...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict is caused by the requested `numpy==2.2.0` package being ignored because it requires a Python version of `>=3.10`, which is incompatible with the current Python environment.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.1.3...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is that the requested `numpy==2.1.3`, along with other specific versions like `numpy==1.14.0`, `numpy==1.16.0`, `numpy==2.1.0`, `numpy==2.3.0`, and `numpy==12.0.0`, requires a Python version of `3.10` or `3.11` or higher, which is not satisfied by the current environment.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.1.2...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is that the requested `numpy==2.1.2` and many other newer package versions, such as `1.14.0`, `1.15.0`, `2.1.0`, `2.1.1`, `2.1.3`, `2.2.0`, `2.3.0`, `2.4.0`, `12.0.0`, `12.1.0`, `2.4.1`, and `2.4.2` (including release candidates), all require a Python environment of `>=3.10` or `>=3.11`, which is incompatible with the currently used Python version.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.1.1...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict occurs because the requested `numpy==2.1.1`, along with numerous other versions like `1.14.0`, `1.16.0`, `12.0.0`, `2.1.0`, `2.3.0`, and `2.4.2`, requires a Python version (either >=3.10 or >=3.11) that is newer than the one currently being used, rendering them unavailable for installation.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.1.0...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is that the current Python environment is incompatible with the explicitly required `numpy==2.1.0`, as well as numerous other modern versions such as `1.14.0`, `1.15.0`, `1.16.0`, `1.17.0`, `2.2.0`, `2.3.0`, `2.4.0`, `12.0.0`, and `12.1.0`, all of which require Python `3.10` or `3.11` or higher.

--- Phase 1: Filtering for compatible versions ---
  -> Checking compatibility of torch==2.10.0...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict stems from an outdated Python environment that causes many package versions, including `torch` versions `2.1.0` (requiring `Python >=3.10`) and `2.3.0` (requiring `Python >=3.11`), to be ignored, while the specifically requested `torch==2.10.0` is not found as an available distribution among any versions up to `2.8.0`.
  -> Checking compatibility of torch==2.9.1...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is that the required `torch==2.9.1` is not available among the found distributions (ranging from `1.7.1` to `2.8.0`), and many other newer `torch` versions, such as `1.14.0`, `1.16.0`, `2.1.0`, and `2.3.0`, were ignored because they explicitly require a higher Python version (>=3.10 or >=3.11) than the one currently in use.

::group::Healing 'scipy': Filter-Then-Scan Strategy

--- Phase 1: Filtering for compatible versions ---
  -> Checking compatibility of scipy==1.17.0...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is that the requested `scipy==1.17.0` requires Python `>=3.11`, but the current Python environment is an older version, causing pip to ignore `scipy` versions `1.14.0` through `1.17.0` (which require Python `>=3.10` or `>=3.11`) and thus fail to find a matching distribution for `scipy==1.17.0`.
  -> Checking compatibility of scipy==1.16.3...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict's root cause is that the requested `scipy==1.16.3` (and many other newer versions like `1.14.0`, `1.15.0`, `1.16.0`, `1.17.0`, `2.3.0`, `2.4.0`) requires a Python environment of version 3.10 or higher (with `scipy==1.16.3` specifically needing >=3.11), which is not met by the current Python setup, causing pip to ignore these incompatible distributions.
  -> Checking compatibility of scipy==1.16.2...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is that `scipy==1.16.2` cannot be found because it requires Python version `3.11` or higher, and all versions from `1.16.0` to `1.17.0rc2` (among others like `2.3.0` to `2.4.2`) were ignored for having this minimum Python version requirement.
  -> Checking compatibility of scipy==1.16.1...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict is caused by the requested `scipy==1.16.1` (and other `scipy` versions like `1.14.0` through `2.4.2`, `12.0.0`, `12.1.0`) requiring Python `>=3.10` or `>=3.11`, which is incompatible with the current Python environment, thus rendering only older `scipy` versions (`0.8.0` through `1.13.1`) available.
  -> Checking compatibility of scipy==1.16.0...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict is caused by the requested package `scipy==1.16.0` requiring Python version `>=3.11`, which is not met by the current Python environment, leading to `scipy==1.16.0` being ignored.
  -> Checking compatibility of scipy==1.15.3...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is that the requested package `scipy==1.15.3`, along with many other modern versions such as `1.14.0` up to `1.17.0`, `2.1.0` up to `2.4.2`, and `12.0.0` up to `12.1.0`, all require Python 3.10 or higher, which is not met by the current Python environment.
  -> Checking compatibility of scipy==1.15.2...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is that the current Python environment is incompatible with the requested `scipy==1.15.2` and other newer `scipy` versions, specifically `1.14.0` through `1.17.0rc2`, because they require `Python >=3.10` or `Python >=3.11`.
  -> Checking compatibility of scipy==1.15.1...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict arises because the requested `scipy==1.15.1`, along with other `scipy` versions such as `1.14.0` through `1.15.3`, `1.16.0` through `1.17.0`, `12.0.0`, `12.1.0`, and `2.1.0` through `2.4.2`, requires a Python version of 3.10 or higher, which the current environment does not provide.
  -> Checking compatibility of scipy==1.15.0...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict is caused by the requested package `scipy==1.15.0` requiring Python >=3.10, which is incompatible with the current Python environment, leading to it being ignored and unavailable.
  -> Checking compatibility of scipy==1.14.1...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is that the requested `scipy==1.14.1` (which requires Python >=3.10), along with other recent versions like `scipy==1.15.0` (Requires-Python >=3.10) and `scipy==1.16.0` (Requires-Python >=3.11), are incompatible with the current Python environment, causing them to be ignored and unavailable.
  -> Checking compatibility of scipy==1.14.0...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict is caused by the requested `scipy==1.14.0` requiring Python >=3.10, which leads `pip` to ignore this and other newer `scipy` versions such as `1.15.0`, `1.16.0`, `2.3.0`, and `12.0.0` due to an incompatible older Python environment.

--- Phase 2: Validating compatible versions (newest first) ---
Result: No compatible versions were found. Reverting to last known good version.

::group::Healing 'torchvision': Filter-Then-Scan Strategy

--- Phase 1: Filtering for compatible versions ---
  -> Checking compatibility of torchvision==0.25.0...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is that the current Python environment does not meet the minimum version requirements (e.g., >=3.10 or >=3.11) needed for `torchvision==0.25.0`, causing it not to be found, while other recent versions such as `1.14.0`, `2.3.0`, and `12.0.0` are similarly ignored due to the Python version mismatch, leaving only `torchvision` versions up to `0.23.0` as compatible.
  -> Checking compatibility of torchvision==0.24.1...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is that the required `torchvision==0.24.1` is not found among the available `torchvision` versions (`0.1.6` through `0.23.0`), and this likely stems from the current Python environment being incompatible with newer releases, as indicated by pip ignoring numerous other package versions like `1.14.0`, `1.15.0`, `1.16.0`, `1.17.0`, `12.0.0`, `2.1.0`, `2.2.0`, `2.3.0`, and `2.4.0` because they require Python >=3.10 or >=3.11.
  -> Checking compatibility of torchvision==0.24.0...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is that the requested `torchvision==0.24.0` cannot be found because the current Python environment is too old to satisfy its requirements, similar to how various other package versions, such as `1.14.0`, `2.3.0`, and `12.0.0`, were ignored for explicitly requiring Python >=3.10 or >=3.11.
